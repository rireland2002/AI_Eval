    "perfectEmail = [\"Good Morning Jemma, I have noticed that you have a large width opening on this roof. Unfortunately, the roof support you have provided is inadequate and will require amending. We can send over a guide with all the steps you need to take, as well as a list of materials you will need. However, we have recently introduced a new webservice, allowing our customers to create and amend roofs themselves. If you would like to follow this path please follow the below link: http://Ultraframe/roof-system/customer-details.co.uk Please get in contact with me or the team if any further details are needed! Many thanks, Raff\"]\n",
