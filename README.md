Personal project entirely independently produced as dissertation submission for final year of university. Created a set of BERT language models and trained them on carefully selected datasets relevant to the problem at hand. The aim of the project was to create a model that could compete with modern day AI detection tools and to evaluate the models against each other to determine advantageous and detrimental factors to their fine tuning. Project received first class commendation.
